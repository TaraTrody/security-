# 5.1 Compare and contrast various types of controls

## Category

- __Managerial__: These controls are administrative in nature and are documented in security policies

- **Operational**: These controls are implemented and done by the people who perform the day-to-day operations

- **Technical**: The use of hardware, software and firmware to reduce risk of security incidents

## Control Type

**Preventive**

 - *Hardening* systems and applications beyond their basic configuration to make them more secure. 
  
 - *Training* users to be aware of security vulnerabilities and understand how to prevent security incidents.
  
 - *Security guards* to prevent and deter threats
  
 - Administrators make configuration changes through a formal *change management* process rather than on the fly to prevent outages
  
 - *Disabling accounts** when employees leave the company
  
 - Block malicious traffic before it reaches a network with *intrusion prevention system* (IPS)
  
**Detective**

 - *Log monitoring* to detect incidents and report them soon after they occur.
 
 - *SIEM systems* to analyze past alerts and understand trends.

 - *Security audit* to determine if security policies are properly implemented

 - *CCTV and motion detection*

 - *Intrusion detection system (IDS)* to detect malicious traffic after it enters a network

**Corrective**

Reverse the impact of security incident after it has occurred. 

 - Recover data from *backups* and disaster recovery plans
 
 - Following *incident handling process* as defined in incident response policy

**Deterrent**

Controls meant to discourage internal/external threats. These can overlap with preventative controls

**Compensating**

Alternative controls used in lieu of primary controls

*e.g Time-based One-Time Passwords(TOTP) for new employees until they receive official Ids for authentication*

**Physical**

Controls you can touch such as locks, barricades, sensors and more. Physical controls can be preventive and deterrent controls
